# runnerSFML

This is a runner game developed for a course in 2017. It was my first fully playable game made with c++ and SFML. I worked with [Macouta](https://github.com/Macouta) on the conception and development.

I tried to implement a multiplayer version of the game but I lacked time to finish it. As it was my first time in network development I went the easy way wich wasn't the best for sure but it allowed me to learn a lot.

## Compile and run

To compile the game you will need [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php) and a c++ commpiler with c++11 enabled. I've never tried to compile on Windows, it probably don't work as we did everything on Debian.
